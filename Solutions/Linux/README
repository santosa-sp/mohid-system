A/ What are the prerequisites to build MOHID in Linux?
1 - Install the zlib package (library file name is "libz.a").
2 - Find, get and compile the HDF5 libraries with "the --enable-fortran" option.

3 - Install the Intel Fortran Compiler (other fortran95 compilers may do as well, but extra configuring is required).

B/ How to build MOHID?
1 - If building for the first time, rename the file "Editme_template.mk" to "Editme.mk" and edit its uncommented lines. (If a fortran95 compiler other than ifort is used, edit the "Nix.mk" file as well).
2 - > make Nix
3 - > make Nix.install

C/ How to erase the MOHID build?
> make Nix.clean

D/ Where do I get the latest version of the code?
http://mohid.codeplex.com

E/ Can I contribute with improvements of the code?
Not directly, but you can submit patches to the code in the codeplex site. We'll check them out and, hopefully, insert them in the new release of the code ;)

F/ How can I activate pre-processor definitions such as _USE_MPI?
Simply edit your Editme.mk and uncomment the commented line containing the desired
pre-processor definition. Then clean and build the makefile over again.

G/ How can I activate the extra modules (e.g: in ConvertToHdf5) that require the netcdf libraries?
1 - Firstly, install the netcdf libraries with the fortran interface and
locate their whereabouts (path) in your computer.
2 - Edit the Editme.mk file and correct the path to the netcdf library libnetcdf.a (NETCDFLIB)
and the netcdf mod file netcdf.mod (NETCDFINC).
3 - Activate to "true" the variable IS_NETCDF in the Editme.mk file

H/ I get "segmentation fault" errors when using ConvertToHDF5 or some other tool, what should I do?
Try to enlarge the cache memory for your programs to run. Simply type
 > ulimit -s unlimited
before running the program.
