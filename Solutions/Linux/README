3 - Install the Intel Fortran Compiler (other fortran95 compilers may do as well, but extra configuring is required).

B/ How to build MOHID?
1 - If building for the first time, rename the file "Editme_template.mk" to "Editme.mk" and edit its uncommented lines. (If a fortran95 compiler other than ifort is used, edit the "Nix.mk" file as well).
2 - > make Nix
3 - > make Nix.install

C/ How to erase the MOHID build?
> make Nix.clean

D/ Where do I get the latest version of the code?
http://mohid.codeplex.com

E/ Can I contribute with improvements of the code?
Not directly, but you can submit patches to the code in the codeplex site. We'll check them out and, hopefully, insert them in the new release of the code ;)
